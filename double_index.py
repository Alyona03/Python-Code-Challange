#Create a function named double_index that has two parameters: a list named lst and a single number named index.
#The function should return a new list where all elements are the same as in lst except for the element at index.
#The element at index should be double the value of the element at index of the original lst.
#If index is not a valid index, the function should return the original list.
#For example, the following code should return [1,2,6,4] because the element at index 2 has been doubled:
#double_index([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)



def double_index(lst, index):
  # Checks to see if index is too big
  if index >= len(lst):
    return lst
  else:
    # Gets the original list up to index
    new_lst = lst[0:index]
 # Adds double the value at index to the new list 
  new_lst.append(lst[index]*2)
  #  Adds the rest of the original list
  new_lst = new_lst + lst[index+1:]
  return new_lst

print(double_index([3, 8, -10, 12], 2))
